	<p>So, you're here to be inspired, to be motivated, to receive whatever knowledge a kid like me can impart to you, well, to be honest, the only piece of advice I can give you right now is to click that return button. No one could have described it better than Anna Kendrick, I'm just a Scrappy Little Nobody, and I bet there thousands of people in the internet INCLUDING Anna that have thrice the experience and a billion times the wisdom who are more worth your internet surfing time. Now my English teacher would call this false humility, but hey, it's not false if it's true, right? Anyway, for those who have stuck around, I guess that makes you guys my guests and me your host, and as your host, it's my job to show you all around, so please, come in and take a peak into my life...</p>
